Once upon a time in a far-off galaxy there lived a young boy named Timmy
He lived on a small planet called Zor and had always been fascinated by the stars
that sparkled in the night sky
One night while gazing up at the stars Timmy saw a shooting star streak across the sky

Excited he made a wish upon the shooting star Suddenly he heard a loud crash behind him
Turning around he saw a small spaceship had landed on his planet
Curious he approached the spaceship and to his amazement he found an alien inside

The alien introduced itself as Zax and it came from a planet that was far far away
Timmy was initially afraid but Zax's friendly demeanor quickly put him at ease
Zax had crash-landed on Timmy's planet and needed Timmy's
help to repair his spaceship so he could go back home

Timmy eagerly agreed to help and spent several weeks working with Zax to fix the spaceship
During that time they became good friends Zax taught Timmy about the
many wonders of the universe and the various creatures that lived in it
Timmy was fascinated by Zax's stories and his vast knowledge

Finally the day arrived when the spaceship was ready to take
off Timmy was sad to see his friend go but he was also happy that he had helped Zax return home
As Zax prepared to leave he gave Timmy a small crystal
that he said would enable him to communicate with him anytime he wanted

Over the next few months Timmy would talk to Zax often
They would share stories and updates about their lives
Timmy would tell Zax about his adventures on Zor and Zax
would tell him about the many exciting places he had visited

One day Timmy received a distress signal from Zax
His planet was under attack from an evil force and he needed Timmy's help
Timmy didn't hesitate for a moment and quickly made his way to Zax's planet
There he found Zax and his people fighting a fierce battle against the invaders

Timmy with the help of Zax managed to defeat the invaders and save Zax
