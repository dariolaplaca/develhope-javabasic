Write a program in Java that reads a text file "file.txt"
containing a series of strings divided by spaces only,
with no punctuation whatsoever.
The file also contains blank lines with a separator function.

The program should perform the following operations:

1_ Load the lines in the file into a list of strings and print the list on the screen.

2_ Calculate the total number of words in the file, excluding the blank lines, and print it on the screen.

3_ Delete any repeated words in the file and print the list of unique words on the screen.

4_ Sort the list of unique words alphabetically and print it on the screen.

5_ Write to a new text file "file_modified.txt" the list of unique words sorted alphabetically, one by line.
