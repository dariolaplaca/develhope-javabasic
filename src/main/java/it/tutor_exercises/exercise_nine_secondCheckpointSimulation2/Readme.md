Sure, here's a prompt for a Java exercise that involves reading and writing external files and string manipulation:

Write a Java program that reads the content of a text file named "input.txt" and performs the following operations:

Remove all occurrences of the word "the" from the content.
Replace all occurrences of the word "and" with "&".
Write the modified content to a new file named "output.txt".
The program should be completed in 30 minutes and should use the following method signatures:

arduino
Copy code
public static String removeWord(String sentence, String word)
This method should remove all occurrences of the specified word from the given sentence and return the modified sentence.

arduino
Copy code
public static String replaceWord(String sentence, String oldWord, String newWord)
This method should replace all occurrences of the specified old word with the given new word in the given sentence and return the modified sentence.

java
Copy code
public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException
This is the main method that should read the content of the "input.txt" file, perform the required operations using the above methods, and write the modified content to the "output.txt" file.

Note: You can assume that both "input.txt" and "output.txt" files are located in the same directory as the Java program.
